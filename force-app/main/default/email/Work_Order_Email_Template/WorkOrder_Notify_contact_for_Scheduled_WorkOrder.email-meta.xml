    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},

I am writing to confirm an upcoming on-site visit. I will plan to arrive at the lab on {!SVMXC__Service_Order__c.SVMXC__Scheduled_Date_Time__c}. The visit is expected to span {!SVMXC__Service_Order__c.SVMXC__SM_Scheduled_Duration__c} hours.

Please let me know if you have any questions. I look forward to working with you and the group.

Best regards,
{!SVMXC__Service_Order__c.SVMXC__Group_Member__c}
