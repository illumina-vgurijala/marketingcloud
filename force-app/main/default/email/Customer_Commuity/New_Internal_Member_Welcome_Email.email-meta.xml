    <textOnly>Hi {!Target_User.FirstName},

You have been granted access to Internal Idea Exchange.

The Internal Idea Exchange is a feedback platform where Illumina employees can propose solutions or enhancements. Ideas should exemplify the voice of the customer or voice of the field teams and are then voted on by other members to drive idea awareness. Ideas are reviewed quarterly by the Voice of Customer team (or more frequently for some Categories) and will advance to the correct Project Management Teams (PMT) for implementation. These ideas are centralized, crowd-sourced, and inform data-driven project prioritization.

To get started, please visit Internal Idea Exchange via Innovation Hub/Ideas(Innohub) app in Salesforce. 

Feel free to contact IdeaExchange@illumina.com anytime with questions or concerns.

Thanks,
Internal Idea Exchange</textOnly>
