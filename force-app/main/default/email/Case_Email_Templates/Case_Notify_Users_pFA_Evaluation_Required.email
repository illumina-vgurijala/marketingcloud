Dear User,

You are receiving this message because you currently own an open SFDC Case <a href ="{!Case.Link}"> {!Case.CaseNumber}</a> where the pFA questions have not been answered.
</br></br>
We require that either the pAE/pFA Evaluation Required field is changed to YES or NO, or the pFA
questions are answered within 7 business days for (pFA) of a case being opened or converted. 
</br></br>
Please remember that the pAE/pFA Evaluation Required field should be set to YES if the answers to ANY one of the following questions is YES: 
</br></br>
pFA Questions:
<ol>
<li>Did the IVD product fail to perform as intended? E.g. product not performing as designed, or
meeting package insert specification such as sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, due to a
product deficiency.</li>
<li>Did the determined issue suggest misbranding, labeling or an adulterated IVD product (defective, unsafe, or contaminated)? E.g. product mislabeled, incorrectly packaged, incorrect instruction in package insert, reagent contains foreign substance. </li>
</ol>
Note: If a Business Issue case is initiated from an existing Field Action, “No” answer can be selected for pFA questions. Justification must be entered in Evaluation field.
